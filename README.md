# Epidemic-Simulation
A simulation written in P5.js to model the spread of an epidemic. A graph is also displayed, which plots the number of removed, infectious, and susceptible people in the simulation as a function of how much time has passed.

## Factors/Controls
A number of factors are built into the simulation in order to model an epidemic, and can be changed in the code. These include: size of people, number of people, infection radius, infection probability, lower and upper limit on infection recovery, etc.
